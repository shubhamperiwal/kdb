# Kdb+

This repository will contain my code used during a workshop on Kdb+ by Kx Systems.
kdb+ is a column-based relational time series database with in-memory abilities, developed and marketed by Kx Systems.
It is used by most of the bugle bracket banks around the world and thrives in analysing financial data.

Over the course of a 2-day workshop, we were introduced to the programming language (Q) and the query language (QSQL) used to extract data from a kdb+ database. 

## Day 1:
We were exposed to different databases available out there and the pros and cons of each of them so that we can make an informed decision on which database to use
We were introduced to different datatypes, lists, tables, reading from CSV files, and finally dabbling with QSQL

## Day 2: 
We went deeper into QSQL, and performed a Data Science Question and exercise to use our newly gained knowledge

I am extremely grateful to the team for coming down and opening our eyes towards Kdb as well all the other databases out there.
I have learned a lot and will attempt to use this language for a project to gain an even deeper understanding of it!
